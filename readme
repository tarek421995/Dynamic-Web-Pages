# Django Project Setup

This document provides step-by-step instructions to set up a Django project, including creating a virtual environment, installing dependencies, configuring the project, and running the local server.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package installer)

## Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment

It's a good practice to use a virtual environment for your projects to manage dependencies.

### Linux and macOS

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to your project directory.
3. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

### Windows

1. Open your command prompt.
2. Navigate to your project directory.
3. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

## Step 2: Install Django and Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install Django LTS (Long Term Support version) and other dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser


```
